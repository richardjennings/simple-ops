# SimpleOps

SimpleOps is a GitOps repository management tool designed to leverage:

* repeatability for verification and consistency
* local and complete dependencies for reliability and resilience
* composition for extensibility
* narrow scope for compatability with a large range of usage patterns


For an example use of SimpleOps to manage a GitOps repository see [Simple Ops Example](https://github.com/richardjennings/simple-ops-example)

## Quick Start

A directory can be created with the structure SimpleOps expects using init:
```
simple-ops init -w /path/to/directory
```
This will create the following structure:
```
# /path/to/directory
charts
config
deploy
with
```
The ```charts``` directory contains helm charts in tgz form added via simple-ops add, alongside and charts authored locally.
    
```config``` contains a yaml configuration file for each component or chart. For example a chart app-1.1.0.tgz should be configured 
via a ```config/app.yml``` configuration file.

```deploy``` contains manifests generated by environment and component. With an environment ```test``` and a component ```myapp```,
the expected structure is ```deploy/test/myapp/manifest.yaml```

```with``` provides a composition alternative to more typical inheritence patterns. Instead of using a parent chart to decorate a component
with ancillaries such as Istio configuration, ```with``` provides a mechanism to define templates that are either included
in the generated manifests or optionally written to a specified path; useful for the management of ArgoCD applications for example.
